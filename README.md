## About The Project



- I have built a sample Java based REST API client for accessing the OGC Features API.

- I am accessing the server at Daara (https://demo.ldproxy.net/daraa) to retrieve the landing page and the list of collections.

- I have unit tests that ensure the models are correctly populated with data.

- I have used SpringBoot and OpenFeign, a declarative REST framework for invoking REST endpoints.

- Service classes call Clients wihich are Feign based interfaces that get the data and populate the models
